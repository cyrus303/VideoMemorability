# VideoMemorability
This project tackles the MediaEval Machine Learning Task where it presents various methods to examine the analytical and aesthetic features of a video clip In addition, examines how the combination of those features affects video memorability

Information and communication technology are
changing swiftly with a major chunk of it being in social
media. The pace at which it is developing is
phenomenal, mobile devices dominate the internet
space by letting them connect to Internet anywhere, at
any time and puts a high-resolution video capturing tool
right in their pocket. The amount of digital content
available online is gigantic and it is almost impossible
to avoid them and besides, not all content is worth
remembering and to tackle this, industry giants are
trying to rope in influential personality to collaborate
with their brands to reach to the masses.

There are plenty of digital content out there and
majority of them being in the advertisement domain
spread across the internet, mainly in social network.
Memorability of the video mainly depends on the
presentation of visual contents and aspects linked to it.
This paper concentrates more on the statistical presence
rather than theoretical or phycological connections
amongst features and memorability. Memorability has
two faces to it, long-term and short-term memorability,
a clear-cut boundary must be drawn between them in
order to predict memorability scores precisely. During
long-term, human brain loses a lot of intricate details
unless they have a relationship linked to it through
hobbies or previous experience.It indicates that
predicting long term memorability of a video feature is
far more challenging than short-term as we are losing a
key aspect of personal touch to the features
